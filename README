WHAT

Framework to write daemons in Debian that listen on a fifo for
commands from another user. The purpose is to securely allow a user to
run predefined commands as root.

There are three possible advantages over using "sudo" for the same
purpose:

 - there is no need to configure /etc/sudoers (which might be
   nontrivial to do automatically)

 - the root process is not exposed to any other influence from the
   other user than what is being read from the fifo (unlike with sudo
   where environment variables, current working directory, and
   possibly more is under the control of the user).

 - only one instance of the root command is run at any one time;
   multiple requests are being stacked up and run one after
   another. So there is no risk of overlapping actions that are meant
   to be isolated (or said differently, no need to care about correct
   locking)


The trickiest part doing this is starting and stopping the daemon.


DEPENDENCIES

start-stop-daemon from Debian (this is present on all Debian
installations, but not part of some other distributions). Not sure
it's worth it, could be replaced.


INSTALL

- check out this directory to /opt/:

   # cd /opt
   # git clone git://github.com/pflanze/Daemon.git 

  In case you want to keep in in a different place, you'll have to
  adapt the paths referring to /opt/Daemon in the examples in the
  'my-service' subdirectory, as well as the 'use lib "/opt/Daemon";'
  lines in _startstop, _daemon and _sender


CONFIGURE

- decide upon a name for your service (for example 'your-service')

- copy the directory "my-service" (which is an example simply printing
  out the message that has been received over the fifo to the log) to
  whereever you want (for example "your-service" in the same parent
  directory), then adapt it:

  * change the contents of settings.sh (most certainly SERVICE_NAME
    and DAEMON_MAINPROGRAM)
  * adapt the path to settings.sh in the 'source ' line of the
    scripts: sender startstop
  * in 'daemon', put your code at '# run your program from here.'
  * move or symlink 'startstop' to '/etc/init.d/your-service',
  * add symlink in /etc/rc2.d/ (use whatever sysv init configuration
    procedure you prefer)
