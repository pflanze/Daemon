Framework to write daemons in Debian that listen on a fifo for
commands from another user. The purpose is to securely allow a user to
run predefined commands as root.

There are three possible advantages over using "sudo" for the same
purpose:

 - there is no need to configure /etc/sudoers (which might be
   nontrivial to do automatically)

 - the root process is not exposed to any other influence from the
   other user than what is being read from the fifo (unlike with sudo
   where environment variables, current working directory, and
   possibly more is under the control of the user).

 - only one instance of the root command is run at any one time;
   multiple requests are being stacked up and run one after
   another. So there is no risk of overlapping actions that are meant
   to be isolated (or said differently, no need to care about correct
   locking)
