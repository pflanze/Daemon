In case you somehow got stuck with an instance that won't be stopped
through running ".../Daemon stop", here is an example how to find the
processes making up the daemon, running the my-service example:


$ ps auxwwf
...
root      6568  0.0  0.1  28984  4744 ?        Ss   23:46   0:00 /usr/bin/perl -w /opt/Daemon/_daemon
root      6569  0.0  0.0   5524   648 ?        S    23:46   0:00  \_ logger -t my-service
...

All these 5 processes are a normal part of the daemon.

If everything is normal, then you will get the following:

chris@novo:~/TEMP/Daemon$ cat /var/run/my-service.pid 
6568

The pid matching the first pid of the above.
